These are three pairs of data files each pair involves a position file and a timestamps file. Here are the file formats:

the position file is in csv format.

Each row is a time when position and head direction were recorded.

the four columns are: 0) timestamp in microseconds when position was recorded, 1) x position of the rat in the arena, 2) y position of rat in the arena and 3) direction of head (in degrees ranging from 0 to 290).

The timestamps file is also csv, although there is only one column per row. Each row contains a timestamp in microseconds when the cell fired an action potential.

Use these two files as we did in class to determine for each spike which direction the head was pointing. From this construct a frequency histogram where the x axis is head direction (in degrees) and the y axis is number of spikes fired for that head direction.  Repeat this for all three cells (grid, place and head). 

Upload the figure of the frequency histogram from the cell whose activity looks most like it encodes direction of the head.
